\item Feedback is the fundamental concept in \emph{cybernetics}.  \dec{Definition?}
\item Feedback about feedback (\&c for higher orders) is relevant to thinking about \emph{learning} and \emph{communication}
\item \emph{Creativity} is often envisaged as cyclical process (e.g.~Dickie's
  art circle, Colton et al.~Iterative
  Development Expression Appreciation).  There are opportunities for
  embedded feedback at each step, and the process itself is ``akin
  to'' a feedback loop.
