\item \textbf{As we happened to be working with \Fw\ to model the
  creative process, we will use \Fw\ as a case study to exemplify how
  to implement this writers workshop model to use feedback within
  being creative.}
\item[] What can we give feedback about in this context?
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Population of nodes}: what can they do?  what do we learn when a

\item \emph{Population of flowcharts}: Simon and Alison have talked

  development framework.
\item \emph{Population of output texts}: how to generate commentary on
  a generated artefact?
\end{enumerate}
\item[] How will the feedback be understood and used?
\begin{enumerate}
\item ?
\item ?
\item Connect commentary on a generated artefact with the code that
  made that artefact.
