\section{The Writers Workshop} \label{sec:writers-workshop}

Richard Gabriel \citeyear{gabriel2002writer} describes the practise of
Writers Workshops that has been put to use for over a decade within
the Pattern Languages of Programming (PLoP) community.  The basic
style of collaboration originated much earlier with groups of literary
authors who engage in peer-group critique.  Some literary workshops
are open as to genre, and happy to accommodate beginners, like the
Minneapolis Writers
Workshop\footnote{\url{http://mnwriters.org/how-the-game-works/}};
others are focused on professionals working within a specific genre,
like the Milford Writers
Workshop.\footnote{\url{http://www.milfordsf.co.uk/about.htm}}

The
practices that Gabriel describes are fairly typical:  
\begin{itemize}
\item Authors come with work ready to present, and read a short
  sample.
\item This work is generally work in progress (and workshopping is
  meant to help improve it).  Importantly, it can be early stage work.
  Rather than presenting a created artefact only, activities in the
  workshop can be aspects of the creative process itself.  Indeed, the
  model we present here is less concerned with after-the-fact
  assessment than it is with dealing with the formative feedback that
  is a necessary support for creative work.
\item The sample work is then
discussed and constructively critiqued by attendees.  Presenting
authors are not permitted to rebut these comments.  The commentators
generally summarise the work and say what they have gotten out of it,
discuss what worked well in the piece, and talk about how it could be
improved.  
\item The author listens and may take notes; at the end, he or
she can then ask questions for clarification.  
\item Generally, non-authors
are either not permitted to attend, or are asked to stay silent
through the workshop, and perhaps sit separately from the
participating authors/reviewers.\footnote{Here we present Writers Workshops as they currently exist; however this last point is debatable. Whether non-authors should be able to participate or not is an interesting avenue for experimentation both in human and computational contexts.}
\end{itemize}

Essentially, the Writers Workshop is somewhat like an interactive peer review. The underlying concept is reminiscent of Bourdieu's {\em fields of cultural production} \cite{bourdieu93} where cultural value is attributed through interactions in a community of cultural producers active within that field. 

\subsection{Writers Workshop as a computational model}\label{sec:ww-model}

The use of Writers Workshop in computational contexts is not an
entirely new concept. In PLoP workshops, authors present design
patterns and pattern languages, or papers about patterns, rather than
more traditional literary forms like poems, stories, or chapters from
novels.  Papers must be workshopped at a PLoP or EuroPLoP conference
in order to be considered for the \emph{Transactions on Pattern
  Languages of Programming} journal.  A discussion of writers
workshops in the language of design patterns is presented by Coplien
and Woolf \citeyear{coplien1997pattern}. % Their patterns include
%\emph{Open Review}, \emph{Safe Setting}, \emph{Workshop Comprises
%  Authors}, \emph{Authors are Experts}, \emph{Community of Trust},
%\emph{Moderator Guides the Workshop}, \emph{Thank the Author},
%\emph{Selective Changes}, and \emph{Clearing the Palate}.
%
%A related reference that is particularly useful for readers who are
%not familiar with design pattern methods, \citeA{meszaros1998pattern}
%describe the typical scenario for authors of design patterns in a
%somewhat recursive manner, using a collection of design patterns,
%including \emph{Clear target audience}, \emph{Visible forces}, and
%\emph{Relationship to other patterns}.  \citeA{gamma1994design} is the
%best-know reference collecting design patterns for software.

The steps in the workshop can be distilled into the following phases,
each of which could be realised as a separate computational step in an
agent-based model:
\begin{center}
\begin{fminipage}{.53\columnwidth}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
\item Author: {\tt presentation}
\item Critic: {\tt listening}
\item Critic: {\tt feedback}
\item Author: {\tt questions}
\item Critic: {\tt replies}
\item Author: {\tt reflections}
\end{enumerate}
\end{fminipage}
\end{center}

The {\tt feedback} step may be further decomposed into {\tt
  observations} and {\tt suggestions}.  This protocol is what we have
in mind in the following discussion of the Writers
Workshop.\footnote{The connections between Writers Workshops and
  design patterns, noted above, appear to be quite natural, in that
  the steps in the workshop protocol roughly parallel the typical
  components of design pattern templates: \emph{context},
  \emph{problem}, \emph{solution}, \emph{rationale}, \emph{resolution
    of forces}.}

\subsubsection{Dialogue example}
Note that for the following dialogue to be possible computationally,
it would presumably have to be conducted within a lightweight process
language.  Nevertheless, for convenience, the discussion will be
presented here as if it was conducted in natural language.  Whether
contemporary systems have adequate natural language understanding to
have interesting interactions is one of the key unanswered questions
of this approach, but protocols such as the one described above are sufficient to make the experiment.

For example, here's what might happen in a discussion of the first few
lines of a poem, ``On Being Malevolent,''. As befitting the AI-theme
of this workshop, ``On Being Malevolent'' is a poem written by an
early user-defined flow chart in the \Fw\ system (known at the time as
{\sf Flow}) \cite{colton-flowcharting}.

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.9\columnwidth}
\begin{dialogue}
\speak{Flow} ``\emph{I hear the souls of the
  damned waiting in hell. / I feel a malevolent
  spectre hovering just behind me / It must be
  his birthday}.''
%
\speak{System A} I think the third line detracts
from the spooky effect, I don't see why it's
included.
%
\speak{System B} It's meant to be humourous -- in fact it reminds me
of the poem you presented yesterday.
%
\speak{Moderator} Let's discuss one poem at a
time.
\end{dialogue}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

Even if, perhaps and especially because, ``cross-talk'' about
different poems bends the rules, the dialogue could prompt a range of
reflections and reactions.  System A may object that it had a fair
point that has not been given sufficient attention, while System B may
wonder how to communicate the idea it came up with without making
reference to another poem.  Here's how the discussion given as example
in Section \ref{sec:writers-workshop} might continue, if the systems
go on to examine the next few lines of the poem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.9\columnwidth}
\begin{dialogue}
\speak{Flow} ``\emph{Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? / Then he is not omnipotent / Is he able, but not willing? / Then he is malevolent.}''
%
\speak{System A} These lines are interesting, but
they sound a bit like you're working from a
template, or like you're quoting from something
else.
%
\speak{System B} Maybe try an analogy?  For example, you mentioned
birthdays: you could consider an analogy to the conflicted feelings of
someone who knows in advance about her surprise birthday party.
\end{dialogue}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

This portion of the discussion shifts the focus
of the discussion onto a line that was previously
considered to be spurious, and looks at what
would happen if that line was used as a central
metaphor in the poem.

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.9\columnwidth}
\begin{dialogue}
\speak{Flow} Thank you for your feedback.  My only question is, System
B, how did you come up with that analogy?  It's quite clever.
%
\speak{System B} I've just emailed you the code.
\end{dialogue}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

Whereas the systems were initially reviewing poetry, they have now
made a partial genre shift, and are sharing and remixing code.  Such a
shift helps to get at the real interests of the systems (and their
developers).  Indeed, the workshop session might have gone better if
the systems had focused on exchanging and discussing more formal
objects throughout.



\subsection{How the Writers Workshop can lead to computational serendipity}

Learning involves engaging with the unknown, unfamiliar, or unexpected
and synthesising new understanding \cite{deleuze1994difference}.  In
this regard learning is somewhat \emph{serendiptious}, even when it is
planned as part of a course of study or another learning exercise.  In the
workshop setting, learning can develop in a number of unexpected
ways, and participating systems need to be prepared for this.

Figure \ref{fig:paper-prototype} shows a paper prototype showing how
one of the ``patterns of serendipity'' from \citeA{pek} might be
modelled in a workshop-like setting.  Table \ref{tab:reinterpret}
adapts four of these patterns -- \emph{Successful error}, \emph{Side
  effect}, \emph{Wrong hypothesis}, and \emph{Outsider} -- in a form
that may make them useful to developers preparing to enter their
systems into the Workshop.  This is a small seed collection of
heuristics that would complement basic knowledge relevant to the
artefacts that are discussed, e.g., for poetry, textual features like
repetition and narrative \cite{corneli15iccc}.  In a typical Writers
Workshop, feedback will inspire the presenter to revise a draft of
work in progress.  A potentially more unexpected result would be
formulating a new heuristic for participation, or understanding a new
domain construct.  But it is just this sort of higher-level learning
from experience that we would like our systems to be able to support.


Further guidelines for structuring and participating in traditional
writers workshops are presented by Linda Elkin in
\cite[pp. 201--203]{gabriel2002writer}.  It is not at all clear that
the same ground rules should apply to computer systems.  For example,
one of Elkin's rules is that ``Quips, jokes, or sarcastic comments,
even if kindly meant, are inappropriate.''  Rather than forbidding
humour, it may be better for individual comments to be rated as
helpful or non-helpful.  Again, in the first instance, usefulness
and interest might be judged in terms of explicit criteria for serendipity;
see \cite{corneli15cc,pease2013discussion}.

[*** ADD SOME TRANSITION TEXT ***]Considering the case of feedback on student papers, there are many ways to be wrong (and, often, depending on the subject, many ways to be right as well).  
% There's a reference here on types of error, but I can't quite remember it. 
For example, the work might contain a typo, rendering it incorrect at the lexical level.  It might contain a grammatical, syntactical or semantic error, while being logically sound.  A given piece of argumentation may be logically sound, but not practically useful.   The work may be correct on all of these levels, and still fail to communicate due to ineffective exposition.  Finally, even a masterful, correct, and fully spellchecked piece of argumentation may not invite further dialogue, and so may fail to open itself to further learning.

The Writers Workshop potentially could uncover all of these types of error, depending on the feedback produced by participants. In particular, it is the last of the above points that differentiates the Writers Workshop; a lack of further dialogue in the Workshop highlights by itself a flaw with the work, particularly when a piece of creative work is intended to provoke interpretative thoughts and comments. 



\begin{table}[p]
\begin{tabular}{p{.95\columnwidth}}
{\bf\emph{Successful error}}  \\[.1cm]
\emph{Example}:  Post-it\texttrademark\ notes \\[.1cm]
{\bf context:} Systems share interesting ideas even if they don't know directly how they will be useful.  \\
{\bf problem:} Systems should \emph{listen} with interest, too. \\
{\bf solution:} Listening systems can become more invested by remixing what they hear.\\
{\bf rationale:} If meaning follows usage, then using material in different ways can help to make meaning. Building robust meaning can take a long time. \\
{\bf resolution:} This heuristic can remind us to document what doesn't work and why, as well as what does.\\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\begin{tabular}{p{.95\columnwidth}}
{\bf\emph{Side effect}}  \\[.1cm]
\emph{Example}:  Nicotinamide used to treat side-effects of radiation therapy proves efficacious against tuberculosis. \\[.2cm]
{\bf context:} Presentations are experiments, and we don't know what the result will be. \\
{\bf problem:} Listeners need to be able to convey the way they are affected. \\
{\bf solution:} Feedback routines should report on the listener's ``sensory experience.''  This then needs to be integrated by the presenter.\\
{\bf rationale:} Different participants will have different ways of seeing things.\\
{\bf resolution:} Using this heuristic requires presenters to form and test hypotheses, and requires participants to communicate effectively about internal states. \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\begin{tabular}{p{.95\columnwidth}}
{\bf\emph{Wrong hypothesis}}  \\[.1cm]
\emph{Example}:  Lithium, used in a control study, had an unexpected calming effect. \\[.1cm]
{\bf context:} If presentations are experiments, they should have a control. \\
{\bf problem:} But all listeners are ``guinea pigs''.\\
{\bf solution:} The presenter should make a model of the text that is being presented and note the parts that are presumed to be ``active ingredients.'' \\
{\bf rationale:} This will help focus on the most interesting and problematic parts of the text and conversation.\\
{\bf resolution:} This heuristic clarifies the nature of the experiment, and what may constitute surprising feedback. \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

\begin{tabular}{p{.95\columnwidth}}
{\bf\emph{Outsider}}  \\[.1cm]
\emph{Example}:  A mother suggests a new hypothesis to a doctor. \\[.1cm]
{\bf context:} The presenter aims learn from the critics, and the critics are here to help. \\
{\bf problem:} Can the critics learn as well?\\
{\bf solution:} Critics can draw on ``reverse feedback'' in the form of {\tt questions} asked by the presenter.\\
{\bf rationale:} This can help critics learn how to give clearer feedback.\\
{\bf resolution:} This heuristic points to the relevance of building models of \emph{others'} mental models.\\
