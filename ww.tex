% First attempt
%% Various social strategies, ranging from Writers Workshops to open
%% source software, pair programming, and design charettes have been
%% developed to exploit emergent effects and to develop new shared
%% language.  We investigate the feasibility of using designs of this
%% sort in multi-agent systems that learn by sharing and discussing
%% partial understandings.  Building on earlier theoretical work, we
%% describe concrete implementation plans and some preliminary results.

% \item[] Research question: \emph{How do we implement feedback in
%  creative systems?}
One particular challenge in AI is the computational modelling and
simulation of creativity.  Feedback and learning from experience are
key aspects of the creative process.  Here we investigate how we could
implement feedback in creative systems, using a social model.
%
We borrow from the field of creative writing and take the concept of a
Writers Workshop as a model for learning through feedback.  The
Writers Workshops encourage examination, discussion and debates of a
piece of creative work in a prescribed format of activities.
%
Surveying the varied ideas attached to the concept of feedback, we see
that several aspects can be present in the workshop setting and that
this format could be useful for shaping work by AI systems that
perform creative tasks.  We propose a computational model as a roadmap
for incorporation of feedback in artificial creativity systems, based
upon the Writers Workshop format.
%
We present a case study on how to implement the Writers Workshop model
in a computational creativity system, at a level that other people
could use to implement similar designs in their own creative systems.
%
We also consider the broader relevance of this model to other relevant
aspects of AI such as the encouragement of serendipity in
computationally intelligent systems, as well as communicative and
cultural AI systems.
